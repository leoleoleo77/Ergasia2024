-STEP A:

Initialising the sequence with 2 symbol(s)
Result: CA

-STEP B:

For the Pattern AATTGA,
There will be 2 symbol(s) replaced/removed
Replacing the symbol at index: 3(T) with G
Replacing the symbol at index: 0(A) with T
Result: TATGGA

For the Pattern CGCTTAT,
There will be 1 symbol(s) replaced/removed
Replacing the symbol at index: 1(G) with A
Result: CACTTAT

For the Pattern GGACTAT,
There will be 2 symbol(s) replaced/removed
Replacing the symbol at index: 0(G) with C
Removing the symbol at index: 6(T)
Result: CGACTA

For the Pattern TTATTCGTA,
There will be 2 symbol(s) replaced/removed
Replacing the symbol at index: 5(C) with A
Replacing the symbol at index: 7(T) with G
Result: TTATTAGGA

-STEP C:

Adding all the patterns to the initial sequence
Also adding the symbol(s) G at the end of the string
Result: CATATGGACACTTATCGACTATTATTAGGAG

Doing this another 49 times and scattering the results between datasetA & datasetB...
